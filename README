This layer hard depends on:

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
branch: master
revision: HEAD

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
branch: master
revision: HEAD

And optionally depends on:

URI: git://git.angstrom-distribution.org/meta-angstrom
branch: master
revision: HEAD

Currently meta-ti only works with the Angstrom distribution and hence
requires the meta-angstrom layer. There are known issues when using
gcc-4.6 based toolchain from OpenEmbedded-Core, thus gcc-4.5 toolchain,
provided by meta-openembedded, is needed. It is planned to fix these
shortcomings in the near future and allow building the base BSP part
of meta-ti with different distributions and layer stacks, such as:
distro-less (only with OE-Core), with Yocto/Poky, with Angstrom or
Arago.

Due to the above, it is now recommended to follow the instructions at
http://www.angstrom-distribution.org/building-angstrom

This will set it up for the OpenEmbedded-core ('yocto') layout instead
of the old "Classic" OpenEmbedded-dev layout. You can optionally tweak
sources/layers.txt and conf/bblayers.conf to (de)select BSP layers.
