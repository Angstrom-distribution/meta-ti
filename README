The official OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for Texas Instruments platforms.

This layer depends on:

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
layers: meta
branch: master
revision: HEAD

URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
layers: meta-oe
branch: master
revision: HEAD

There are known issues when using a toolchain with gcc-4.6 and binutils-2.22
from OpenEmbedded-Core, thus it is recommended to use meta-openembedded layer
with gcc-4.5 + Linaro patches and binutils-2.20.1.

The base BSP part of meta-ti should work with different OpenEmbedded/Yocto
distributions and layer stacks, such as:
distro-less (only with OE-Core), with Yocto/Poky, with Angstrom or Arago.

Please follow the recommended setup procedures of your OE distribution. When
using in a distro-less configuration, please add to your local.conf:

GCCVERSION = "4.5%"
BINUVERSION = "2.20.1"
