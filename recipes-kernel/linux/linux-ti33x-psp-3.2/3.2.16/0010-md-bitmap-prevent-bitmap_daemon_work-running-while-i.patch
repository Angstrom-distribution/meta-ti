Subject: [PATCH 10/68] md/bitmap: prevent bitmap_daemon_work running while
 initialising bitmap

commit afbaa90b80b1ec66e5137cc3824746bfdf559b18 upstream.

If a bitmap is added while the array is active, it is possible
for bitmap_daemon_work to run while the bitmap is being
initialised.
This is particularly a problem if bitmap_daemon_work sees
bitmap->filemap as non-NULL before it has been filled in properly.
So hold bitmap_info.mutex while filling in ->filemap
to prevent problems.

This patch is suitable for any -stable kernel, though it might not
apply cleanly before about 3.1.
