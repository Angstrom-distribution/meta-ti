Subject: [PATCH 035/153] timeconst.pl: Eliminate Perl warning

commit 63a3f603413ffe82ad775f2d62a5afff87fd94a0 upstream.

defined(@array) is deprecated in Perl and gives off a warning.
Restructure the code to remove that warning.

[ hpa: it would be interesting to revert to the timeconst.bc script.
  It appears that the failures reported by akpm during testing of
  that script was due to a known broken version of make, not a problem
  with bc.  The Makefile rules could probably be restructured to avoid
  the make bug, or it is probably old enough that it doesn't matter. ]
