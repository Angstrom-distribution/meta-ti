Subject: [PATCH 010/109] vfs: dcache: use DCACHE_DENTRY_KILLED instead of
 DCACHE_DISCONNECTED in d_kill()

commit b161dfa6937ae46d50adce8a7c6b12233e96e7bd upstream.

IBM reported a soft lockup after applying the fix for the rename_lock
deadlock.  Commit c83ce989cb5f ("VFS: Fix the nfs sillyrename regression
in kernel 2.6.38") was found to be the culprit.

The nfs sillyrename fix used DCACHE_DISCONNECTED to indicate that the
dentry was killed.  This flag can be set on non-killed dentries too,
which results in infinite retries when trying to traverse the dentry
tree.

This patch introduces a separate flag: DCACHE_DENTRY_KILLED, which is
only set in d_kill() and makes try_to_ascend() test only this flag.

IBM reported successful test results with this patch.
