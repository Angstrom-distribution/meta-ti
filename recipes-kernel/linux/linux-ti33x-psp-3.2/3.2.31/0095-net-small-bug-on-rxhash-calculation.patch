Subject: [PATCH 095/109] net: small bug on rxhash calculation

[ Upstream commit 6862234238e84648c305526af2edd98badcad1e0 ]

In the current rxhash calculation function, while the
sorting of the ports/addrs is coherent (you get the
same rxhash for packets sharing the same 4-tuple, in
both directions), ports and addrs are sorted
independently. This implies packets from a connection
between the same addresses but crossed ports hash to
the same rxhash.

For example, traffic between A=S:l and B=L:s is hashed
(in both directions) from {L, S, {s, l}}. The same
rxhash is obtained for packets between C=S:s and D=L:l.

This patch ensures that you either swap both addrs and ports,
or you swap none. Traffic between A and B, and traffic
between C and D, get their rxhash from different sources
({L, S, {l, s}} for A<->B, and {L, S, {s, l}} for C<->D)

The patch is co-written with Eric Dumazet <edumazet@google.com>
