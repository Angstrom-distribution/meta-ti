Subject: [PATCH 08/46] mm: Fix PageHead when !CONFIG_PAGEFLAGS_EXTENDED

commit ad4b3fb7ff9940bcdb1e4cd62bd189d10fa636ba upstream.

Unfortunately with !CONFIG_PAGEFLAGS_EXTENDED, (!PageHead) is false, and
(PageHead) is true, for tail pages.  If this is indeed the intended
behavior, which I doubt because it breaks cache cleaning on some ARM
systems, then the nomenclature is highly problematic.

This patch makes sure PageHead is only true for head pages and PageTail
is only true for tail pages, and neither is true for non-compound pages.

[ This buglet seems ancient - seems to have been introduced back in Apr
  2008 in commit 6a1e7f777f61: "pageflags: convert to the use of new
  macros".  And the reason nobody noticed is because the PageHead()
  tests are almost all about just sanity-checking, and only used on
  pages that are actual page heads.  The fact that the old code returned
  true for tail pages too was thus not really noticeable.   - Linus ]
