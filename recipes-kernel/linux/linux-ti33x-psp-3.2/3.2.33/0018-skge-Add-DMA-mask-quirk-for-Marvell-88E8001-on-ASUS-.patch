Subject: [PATCH 018/105] skge: Add DMA mask quirk for Marvell 88E8001 on ASUS
 P5NSLI motherboard

[ Upstream commit a2af139ff1cd85df586690ff626619ab1ee88b0a ]

Marvell 88E8001 on an ASUS P5NSLI motherboard is unable to send/receive
packets on a system with >4gb ram unless a 32bit DMA mask is used.

This issue has been around for years and a fix was sent 3.5 years ago, but
there was some debate as to whether it should instead be fixed as a PCI quirk.

However, 18 months later a similar workaround was introduced for another
chipset exhibiting the same problem.
