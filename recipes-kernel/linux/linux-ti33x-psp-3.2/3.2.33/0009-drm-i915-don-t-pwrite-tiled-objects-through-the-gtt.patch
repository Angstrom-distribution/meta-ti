Subject: [PATCH 009/105] drm/i915: don't pwrite tiled objects through the gtt

commit c07496fa61f4c5cb2addd1c57f6b22fcaeea2eeb upstream.

... we will botch up the bit17 swizzling. Furthermore tiled pwrite is
a (now) unused slowpath, so no one really cares.

This fixes the last swizzling issues I have with i-g-t on my bit17
swizzling i915G. No regression, it's been broken since the dawn of
gem, but it's nice for regression tracking when really _all_ i-g-t
tests work.

Actually this is not true, Chris Wilson noticed while reviewing this
patch that the commit
