Subject: [PATCH 27/70] video/smscufx: fix line counting in fb_write

commit 2fe2d9f47cfe1a3e66e7d087368b3d7155b04c15 upstream.

Line 0 and 1 were both written to line 0 (on the display) and all subsequent
lines had an offset of -1. The result was that the last line on the display
was never overwritten by writes to /dev/fbN.

The origin of this bug seems to have been udlfb.
