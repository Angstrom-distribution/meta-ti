Subject: [PATCH 13/82] ath9k: fix RSSI dummy marker value

commit a3d63cadbad97671d740a9698acc2c95d1ca6e79 upstream.

RSSI is being stored internally as s8 in several places. The indication
of an unset RSSI value, ATH_RSSI_DUMMY_MARKER, was supposed to have been
set to 127, but ended up being set to 0x127 because of a code cleanup
mistake. This could lead to invalid signal strength values in a few
places.
