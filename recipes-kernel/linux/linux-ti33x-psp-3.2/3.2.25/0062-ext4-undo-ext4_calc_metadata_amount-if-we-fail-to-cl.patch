Subject: [PATCH 62/73] ext4: undo ext4_calc_metadata_amount if we fail to
 claim space

commit 03179fe92318e7934c180d96f12eff2cb36ef7b6 upstream.

The function ext4_calc_metadata_amount() has side effects, although
it's not obvious from its function name.  So if we fail to claim
space, regardless of whether we retry to claim the space again, or
return an error, we need to undo these side effects.

Otherwise we can end up incorrectly calculating the number of metadata
blocks needed for the operation, which was responsible for an xfstests
failure for test #271 when using an ext2 file system with delalloc
enabled.
