Subject: [PATCH 23/73] r8169: RxConfig hack for the 8168evl.

commit eb2dc35d99028b698cdedba4f5522bc43e576bd2 upstream.

The 8168evl (RTL_GIGA_MAC_VER_34) based Gigabyte GA-990FXA motherboards
are very prone to NETDEV watchdog problems without this change. See
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42899 for instance.

I don't know why it *works*. It's depressingly effective though.

For the record:
- the problem may go along IOMMU (AMD-Vi) errors but it really looks
  like a red herring.
- the patch sets the RX_MULTI_EN bit. If the 8168c doc is any guide,
  the chipset now fetches several Rx descriptors at a time.
- long ago the driver ignored the RX_MULTI_EN bit.
  e542a2269f232d61270ceddd42b73a4348dee2bb changed the RxConfig
  settings. Whatever the problem it's now labeled a regression.
- Realtek's own driver can identify two different 8168evl devices
  (CFG_METHOD_16 and CFG_METHOD_17) where the r8169 driver only
  sees one. It sucks.
