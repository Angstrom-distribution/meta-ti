Subject: [PATCH 56/73] fix eh wakeup (scsi_schedule_eh vs
 scsi_restart_operations)

commit 57fc2e335fd3c2f898ee73570dc81426c28dc7b4 upstream.

Rapid ata hotplug on a libsas controller results in cases where libsas
is waiting indefinitely on eh to perform an ata probe.

A race exists between scsi_schedule_eh() and scsi_restart_operations()
in the case when scsi_restart_operations() issues i/o to other devices
in the sas domain.  When this happens the host state transitions from
SHOST_RECOVERY (set by scsi_schedule_eh) back to SHOST_RUNNING and
->host_busy is non-zero so we put the eh thread to sleep even though
->host_eh_scheduled is active.

Before putting the error handler to sleep we need to check if the
host_state needs to return to SHOST_RECOVERY for another trip through
eh.  Since i/o that is released by scsi_restart_operations has been
blocked for at least one eh cycle, this implementation allows those
i/o's to run before another eh cycle starts to discourage hung task
timeouts.
