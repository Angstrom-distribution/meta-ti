Subject: [PATCH 080/146] mtd: nandsim: bugfix: fail if overridesize is too
 big

commit bb0a13a13411c4ce24c48c8ff3cdf7b48d237240 upstream.

If override size is too big, the module was actually loaded instead of
failing, because retval was not set.

This lead to memory corruption with the use of the freed structs nandsim
and nand_chip.
