Subject: [PATCH 022/146] xhci: Warn when hosts don't halt.

commit 5af98bb06dee79d28c805f9fd0805ce791121784 upstream.

Eric Fu reports a problem with his VIA host controller fetching a zeroed
event ring pointer on resume from suspend.  The host should have been
halted, but we can't be sure because that code ignores the return value
from xhci_halt().  Print a warning when the host controller refuses to
halt within XHCI_MAX_HALT_USEC (currently 16 seconds).

(Update: it turns out that the VIA host controller is reporting a halted
state when it fetches the zeroed event ring pointer.  However, we still
need this warning for other host controllers.)
