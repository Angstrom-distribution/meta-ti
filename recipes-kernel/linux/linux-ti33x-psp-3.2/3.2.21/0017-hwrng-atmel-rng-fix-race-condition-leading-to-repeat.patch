Subject: [PATCH 17/67] hwrng: atmel-rng - fix race condition leading to
 repeated bits

commit 121daad8fd1dce63076fa55aaedd5dc3f981b334 upstream.

Data valid gets cleared by reading the ISR (status register) and NOT from
reading ODATA (data register). A new data word can become available between
checking ISR and reading ODATA, causing us to reuse the same data word next
time atmel_trng_read() gets called, if that happens before the following
data word is ready.

With this fixed, rngtest no longer complains of 'Continous run' errors.
Before:

rngtest -c 1000 < /dev/hwrng
rngtest 3
