Subject: [PATCH 63/67] usb: cdc-acm: fix devices not unthrottled on open

commit 6c4707f3f8c44ec18282e1c014c80e1c257042f9 upstream.

Currently CDC-ACM devices stay throttled when their TTY is closed while
throttled, stalling further communication attempts after the next open.

Unthrottling during open/activate got lost starting with kernel
3.0.0 and this patch reintroduces it.
