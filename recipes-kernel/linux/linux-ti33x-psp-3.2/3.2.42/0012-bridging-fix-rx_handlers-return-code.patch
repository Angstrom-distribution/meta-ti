Subject: [PATCH 12/92] bridging: fix rx_handlers return code

[ Upstream commit 3bc1b1add7a8484cc4a261c3e128dbe1528ce01f ]

The frames for which rx_handlers return RX_HANDLER_CONSUMED are no longer
counted as dropped. They are counted as successfully received by
'netif_receive_skb'.

This allows network interface drivers to correctly update their RX-OK and
RX-DRP counters based on the result of 'netif_receive_skb'.
