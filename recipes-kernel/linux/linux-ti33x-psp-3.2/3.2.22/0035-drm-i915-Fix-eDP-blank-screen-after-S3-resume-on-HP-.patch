Subject: [PATCH 35/46] drm/i915: Fix eDP blank screen after S3 resume on HP
 desktops

commit 6db65cbb941f9d433659bdad02b307f6d94465df upstream.

This patch fixes the problem on some HP desktop machines with eDP
which give blank screens after S3 resume.

It turned out that BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL must be written after
BLC_PWM_CPU_CTL2.  Otherwise it doesn't take effect on these
SNB machines.

Tested with 3.5-rc3 kernel.
