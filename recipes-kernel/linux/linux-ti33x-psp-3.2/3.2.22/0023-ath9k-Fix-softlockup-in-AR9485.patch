Subject: [PATCH 23/46] ath9k: Fix softlockup in AR9485

commit bcb7ad7bcbef030e6ba71ede1f9866368aca7c99 upstream.

steps to recreate:
load latest ath9k driver with AR9485
stop the network-manager and wpa_supplicant
bring the interface up

	Call Trace:

ensure that the PLL-WAR for AR9485/AR9340 is executed only if the STA is
associated (or) IBSS/AP mode had started beaconing. Ideally this WAR
is needed to recover from some rare beacon stuck during stress testing.
Before the STA is associated/IBSS had started beaconing, PLL4(0x1618c)
always seem to have zero even though we had configured PLL3(0x16188) to
query about PLL's locking status. When we keep on polling infinitely PLL4's
8th bit(ie check for PLL locking measurements is done), machine hangs
due to softlockup.
