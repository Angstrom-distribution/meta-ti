Subject: [PATCH 085/171] USB: mark uas driver as BROKEN

commit fb37ef98015f864d22be223a0e0d93547cd1d4ef upstream.

As reported https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51031, the UAS
driver causes problems and has been asked to be not built into any of
the major distributions.  To prevent users from running into problems
with it, and for distros that were not notified, just mark the whole
thing as broken.
