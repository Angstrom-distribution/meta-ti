Subject: [PATCH 022/165] mm: fix s390 BUG by __set_page_dirty_no_writeback on
 swap

commit aca50bd3b4c4bb5528a1878158ba7abce41de534 upstream.

Mel reports a BUG_ON(slot == NULL) in radix_tree_tag_set() on s390
3.0.13: called from __set_page_dirty_nobuffers() when page_remove_rmap()
tries to transfer dirty flag from s390 storage key to struct page and
radix_tree.

That would be because of reclaim's shrink_page_list() calling
add_to_swap() on this page at the same time: first PageSwapCache is set
(causing page_mapping(page) to appear as &swapper_space), then
page->private set, then tree_lock taken, then page inserted into
radix_tree - so there's an interval before taking the lock when the
radix_tree slot is empty.

We could fix this by moving __add_to_swap_cache()'s spin_lock_irq up
before the SetPageSwapCache.  But a better fix is simply to do what's
five years overdue: Ken Chen introduced __set_page_dirty_no_writeback()
(if !PageDirty TestSetPageDirty) for tmpfs to skip all the radix_tree
overhead, and swap is just the same - it ignores the radix_tree tag, and
does not participate in dirty page accounting, so should be using
__set_page_dirty_no_writeback() too.

s390 testing now confirms that this does indeed fix the problem.
