Subject: [PATCH 111/165] ALSA: HDA: Add external mic quirk for Asus Zenbook
 UX31E

commit 5ac57550f279c3d991ef0b398681bcaca18169f7 upstream.

According to the reporter, external mic starts to work if the
laptop-dmic model is used. According to BIOS pin config, all
pins are consistent with the alc269vb_laptop_dmic fixup, except
for the external mic, which is not present.
