Subject: [PATCH 030/165] EHCI: always clear the STS_FLR status bit

commit 2fbe2bf1fd37f9d99950bd8d8093623cf22cf08b upstream.

This patch (as1544) fixes a problem affecting some EHCI controllers.
They can generate interrupts whenever the STS_FLR status bit is turned
on, even though that bit is masked out in the Interrupt Enable
register.

Since the driver doesn't use STS_FLR anyway, the patch changes the
interrupt routine to clear that bit whenever it is set, rather than
leaving it alone.
