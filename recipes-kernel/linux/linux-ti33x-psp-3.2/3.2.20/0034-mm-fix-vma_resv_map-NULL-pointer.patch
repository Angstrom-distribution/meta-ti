Subject: [PATCH 34/86] mm: fix vma_resv_map() NULL pointer

commit 4523e1458566a0e8ecfaff90f380dd23acc44d27 upstream.

hugetlb_reserve_pages() can be used for either normal file-backed
hugetlbfs mappings, or MAP_HUGETLB.  In the MAP_HUGETLB, semi-anonymous
mode, there is not a VMA around.  The new call to resv_map_put() assumed
that there was, and resulted in a NULL pointer dereference:

  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000030

This was reported by Dave Jones, but was reproducible with the
libhugetlbfs test cases, so shame on me for not running them in the
first place.

With this, the oops is gone, and the output of libhugetlbfs's
run_tests.py is identical to plain 3.4 again.

[ Marked for stable, since this was introduced by commit c50ac050811d
  ("hugetlb: fix resv_map leak in error path") which was also marked for
  stable ]
