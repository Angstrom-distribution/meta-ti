Subject: [PATCH 47/60] x86/PCI: do not tie MSI MS-7253 use_crs quirk to BIOS
 version

commit a97f4f5e524bcd09a85ef0b8821a14d35e69335f upstream.

Carlos was getting

	WARNING: at drivers/pci/pci.c:118 pci_ioremap_bar+0x24/0x52()

when probing his sound card, and sound did not work.  After adding
pci=use_crs to the kernel command line, no more trouble.

Ok, we can add a quirk.  dmidecode output reveals that this is an MSI
MS-7253, for which we already have a quirk, but the short-sighted
author tied the quirk to a single BIOS version, making it not kick in
on Carlos's machine with BIOS V1.2.  If a later BIOS update makes it
no longer necessary to look at the _CRS info it will still be
harmless, so let's stop trying to guess which versions have and don't
have accurate _CRS tables.
