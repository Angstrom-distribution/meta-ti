Subject: [PATCH 39/60] ARM: tegra: remove Tegra30 errata from MACH_TEGRA_DT

[no upstream commit match, as this is a fix for a mis-applied patch in the
previous 3.2-stable release. - gregkh]

Commit 83e4194 "ARM: tegra: select required CPU and L2 errata options"
contained two chunks; one was errata for Tegra20 (correctly applied)
and the second errata for Tegra30. The latter was accidentally applied
to the wrong config option; Tegra30 support wasn't added until v3.3,
and so the second chunk should have just been dropped. This patch does
so.
