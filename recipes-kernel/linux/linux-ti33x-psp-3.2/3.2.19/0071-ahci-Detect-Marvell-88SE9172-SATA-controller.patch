Subject: [PATCH 071/117] ahci: Detect Marvell 88SE9172 SATA controller

commit 642d89252201c4155fc3946bf9cdea409e5d263e upstream.

The Marvell 88SE9172 SATA controller (PCI ID 1b4b 917a) already worked
once it was detected, but was missing an ahci_pci_tbl entry.

Boot tested on a Gigabyte Z68X-UD3H-B3 motherboard.
