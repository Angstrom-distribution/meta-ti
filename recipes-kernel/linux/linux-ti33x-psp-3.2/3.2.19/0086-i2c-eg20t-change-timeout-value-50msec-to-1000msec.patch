Subject: [PATCH 086/117] i2c-eg20t: change timeout value 50msec to 1000msec

commit 8a52f9f347da721b199b7f9dcc0168bbe7d0baae upstream.

Currently, during i2c works alone, wait-event timeout is not occurred.
However, as CPU load increases, timeout occurs frequently.
So, I modified like this patch.
Modifying like this patch, I've never seen the timeout event with high
load test.
